Multi-modal dynamic transit assignment incorporating bike-sharing
This project provides a dynamic transit assignment algorithm considering shared bikes.
It can be used to analyze the travel paths of passengers in a public transit network with buses, subways, and shared bikes, and calculate various transit modes of passenger flow to help improve the operation of public transit.
